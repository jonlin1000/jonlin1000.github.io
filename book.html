		<br>

		I was motivated to start writing this book after I had taken an honors differential equations course at my university. 
		It was an interestingly structured course, in that the instructor first covered some linear algebra (up to a description of the 
		Jordan normal form) and then started from the differential equations.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		Needless to say, I'm not sure that I got as much out of that course as I wanted to. Though we eventually ended up covering some interesting
		topics, such as the theory of equilibrium solutions, stability, and limit cycles (termed ``orbits'' in our class), it was sufficiently too late
		in the semester for me to really appreciate that these topics and themes were the most important to understanding the topic at hand. Earlier in the
		course, the instructor went through the standard sorts of differential equations that were covered throughout the course, such as separable equations,
		first order linear equations, etc. He went through the standard gamut of all things in a standard differential equations course, including systems of
		differential equations.

		<br>
		<br>
		The problem with this approach is that as many who I talked to have noted, this ``bag-of-tricks'' method which applies to solve differential equations
		is a complete demotivator for me and many others. The way the topics were presented made the whole subject seem kind of pointless. Though the study of the stability of certain systems of differential equations is interesting, the more computational focus on definitionally proving stability in the class
		made the whole class lose interest (It's pretty difficult to get people excited about $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$!).

		<br>
		<br>
		I, and many others, found the class computational, rather boring, even pointless. This is a problem, because the theory of differential equations is so 
		important in many areas of mathematics, in engineering, and in the sciences. Many computational methods of the physical sciences explicitly use the tools 
		of differential equations to accurately model the physical world to extreme precisions. If you hear about any subject which deals with any sort of 
		change or evolution or time chances are they deal with differential equations all the time.

		<br>
		<br>
		Most courses and textbooks which cover differential equations completely fail to convey the importance of differential equations, both as an area
		of mathematics and the importance of its applications in the sciences. Most of the examples and techniques in the book, the ``bag-of-tricks'', as called
		earlier, are usually completely irrelevant to the applications of today. Scarcely will you see anyone use some technique like integrating factors or
		variation of parameters in some real-life scenario.
