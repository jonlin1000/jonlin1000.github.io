<strong>Mathematical Interests</strong><br>
<br>

I'm interested in most areas of mathematics, and interested in learning more. <br>
My primary area of interest would probably best be described as "analysis".

<br>
Here some books or notes I am reading through or interested in going through. If you are interested in reading them with me please shoot me an email.<br>
<br>

Bedrossian and Vicol, <b>The Mathematical Analysis of the Incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes Equations</b><br>
Michael Spivak, <b>Differential Geometry Vol. 1</b><br>
Evans and Gariepy, <b>Measure Theory and Fine Properties of Functions</b><br>
Vladimir Arnold, <b>Ordinary Differential Equations</b><br>
Brin and Stuck, <b>Introduction to Dynamical Systems</b><br>
Han and Lin, <b>Elliptic Partial Differential Equations </b><br>
Donaldson, <b>Riemann Surfaces</b><br>
Ivey and Landsburg, <b>Cartan for Beginners</b><br>

Some cool things I do/have done:<br>

<br>
Attended the <a href="http://lymanbriggs.msu.edu/SURIEM/">SURIEM</a> REU (undergraduate research summer program). I studied the combinatorics of various structures, such as
action graphs and equivariant trees. I presented <a href="JMM_2020_Poster.pdf">this poster</a> summarizing the successful research at the 2020 JMM Undergraduate Poster Session.

<br>

Online camp counselor for the 2020 Online <a href="https://rossprogram.org/">Ross Mathematics Program</a>. I mentored 4 highschoolers virtually on number theoretic topics. <br>
I also took courses that were held about analytic number theory and equidistribution. <br>

I am the former president of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/566598730042813/">Rubik's Cube Club at UMD</a>.
